<h1>How to use</h1>
Steps:<br>
<ol><li>Once a new tab is opened, there will be a <b>'helper'</b> area showing two buttons, <b>'add'</b> and <b>'delete'</b>. And there will be an input area that is showing the selected <i>div's</i> id. The 'x' mark on the top right is a close button that can close itself. <a href='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/helper.PNG'>https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/helper.PNG</a>
</li><li>Firstly, click somewhere in an area and the <i>div</i> containing it would be changed <b>yellow</b> background. The color can be changed in options. <a href='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/select.PNG'>https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/select.PNG</a>
</li><li>If you want to merge that yellow area, you should click the  <b>'add'</b> button. And it would show the div's information as a list. <a href='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/add.PNG'>https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/add.PNG</a>
</li><li>If you ever click that area, but now you want to delete it, check the checkboxes and click <b>'delete'</b> button. And the selected divs will be deleted. Or you can delete all selected <i>divs</i> in the popup window by clicking the button 'clear', which I will explain in the below steps. <a href='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/delete1.PNG'>https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/delete1.PNG</a>
</li><li>After you finished adding <i>divs</i>, you can click our extension's icon.  And then click <b>'Merge'</b>. <img src='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/popup.png' />
</li><li>All the above add,delete,merge operation can also be done by right click your mouse and find the PageMerger Menu. 'Result' represents 'merge' operation. <img src='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/contextmenu.png' />
</li><li>A new tab would pop out showing your added <i>divs</i> in one page.  <a href='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/result.PNG'>https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/result.PNG</a> You can click left or right button below the thumbnails to decide which side you want to put that div. Also you can add more than 2 <i>divs</i> and it would show their thumbnails, but only two pages can be displayed at the same time. The old page can be replaced if you click a new page's 'left' or 'right' button. <a href='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/replace.PNG'>https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/replace.PNG</a>
</li><li>You can also change the location of the two <i>divs</i> in the result page by clicking the arrow in the right page. You can also click the question mark and it will pop up a window telling you the function of these buttons. <a href='https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/instruction.PNG'>https://googledrive.com/host/0B-063CZNG9hsZGIySTNxeFdrb1k/instruction.PNG</a></li></ol>

<h1>Set options</h1>
We have two preference options for color and the helper, which appears to the left-up part of the page.<br>
You can choose color and choose to enable the helper.<br>

<h1>Web pages not applicable for our extension</h1>
After we do tests on various sites, we have found some websites don't like iframe, which makes our extension unusable. These websites are google and stackoverflow.
